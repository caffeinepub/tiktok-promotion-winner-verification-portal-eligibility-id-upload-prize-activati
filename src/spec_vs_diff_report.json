  "summary": "The diff largely implements the Prize Portal rebrand across core screens: updated header/footer branding, replaced TikTok/neon asset references with Prize Portal asset filenames, updated eligibility checklist text to be generic, and introduced a new gold/amber-based theme via CSS variables and Tailwind extensions. However, the diff does not show the required generated image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and it introduces a new React Query hooks file that was not requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the app loads the new Prize Portal generated assets from frontend/public/assets/generated and that all referenced generated assets exist under that directory.",
      "reason": "UI components were updated to reference new Prize Portal asset filenames, but the diff shows no added files and no changes under frontend/public/assets/generated, so there is no evidence the required images were actually added to the repo.",
